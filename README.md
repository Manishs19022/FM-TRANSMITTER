# FM-TRANSMITTER

FM transmitter is an electronic device, which produces frequency-modulated waves with  the help of an antenna. The FM transmitter is a low-power transmitter and it uses FM waves  for transmitting the sound, this transmitter transmits the audio signals through the carrier  wave by the difference of frequency.

A transmitter generates FM waves for various purposes such as communication, 
broadcasting a message, etc. The signal transmitted has a limited range for its reception, as 
we increase our distance from the source, the signal received is merged with noise and 
furthermore noise component dominates the signal transmitted hence message cannot be 
received successfully after a certain distance due to obstacles. 

The power source is a 9v de battery. The information that is provided to the transmitter is 
in the form of an electronic signal. This includes audio from a microphone or any other 
means like aux-in. The transmitter combines the information signal that is to be carried 
with the RF signal (the carrier). This is called modulation. In an FM transmitter, the 
information is added to the radio signal by slightly varying the radio signal's frequency.

# OBJECTIVES :
FM transmitters aim to deliver high-quality and clear audio transmission. Maintaining a 
good signal-to-noise ratio and minimizing signal distortion are essential to ensure that the 
transmitted audio is received and reproduced accurately by FM receivers. 

The main objective of an FM transmitter is to transmit audio signals, such as music, speech, 
or other forms of audio content, over the airwaves using Frequency Modulation (FM) 
technology. This allows the audio to be received and played back by FM radios within the 
transmitter's range. 

# PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Audio signals have an inherently low frequency. Transmission of low-frequency signals 
requires large antenna sizes due to high signal attenuation. Modulation of audio signals is 
typically achieved using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).

Frequency modulation is achieved by varying the carrier frequency with changes in the 
amplitude of the audio signal (i.e. the modulating signal). AM is the variation in carrier 
amplitude relative to the audio signal.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE 
• What we have in this system built is a FM modulator that modulates the input signal 
and then transmit it in the FM band through the antenna of the system.  

• This input signal is the electrical pulse generated by the phone that is connected to 
the circuit through aux-in which acts as a transducer that converts the voice or music 
into electrical pulse. The transmitted FM waves can be received by any standard 
FM Radio receiver of cell phones having FM receiver integrated in them. 

• 88 MHz to 108 MHz is the range in which carrier frequency can be chosen. The 
modulation circuit consists of a coil, a transistor along with their biasing circuit signal when received in any standard FM receiver and amplified and given to large speakers the 
voice of the addressee can reach to a large audience. 

• The formation of the oscillating tank circuit can be done through the transistor of 
BC547 by using the inductor and variable capacitor. From this we can transmit FM 
radio frequency to the nearest FM receiver that can be any mobile or radio

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

All connections have been built as per the circuit diagram on a zero PCB board. When 
testing the transmitter, the oscillator coil is tuned properly so that is transmits at the 
right frequency. 

This is done using a using a screwdriver for the adjustment. The operating frequency of the oscillator is supposed to be very high so every precaution is taken to avoid the use of tools such as a metal, or even bare fingers which can detune the oscillator. 

The FM radio is tuned to the specified frequency 90MHz and kept within the maximum 
distance of 10 meters. Then the audio played via transmitter is received by the radio. 
Instantly the background noise diminishes and the audible message is heard.

The FM tuning circuit can modulate a low frequency signal with the help of a high frequency 
signal and we can communicate with others with same frequency over a particular 
range. We faced difficulty in tuning the oscillator circuit as it was done manually. Even 
a slight nick in turning the variable capacitor while tuning can detune the whole circuit. 
For this design, a 6 turn coil of diameter 5 mm wound on a 7 mm length is used.
